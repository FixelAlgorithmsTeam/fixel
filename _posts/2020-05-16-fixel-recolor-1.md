# Fixel Recolor 1.5 - Machine Learning Powered, Recoloring, Color Grading and Style Transfer for Photographers and Designers

We have updated [Fixel Recolor 1][98]. We have gathered feedback since launch and thought on some improvements on our own. Now it is time to share with you.  
So let's see what's new on [Fixel Recolor 1.5][98].  

## UI Updated

We updated the UI to use [Adobe's UI Library - Spectrum CSS][02]:

Functionality is mostly the same with support for the new features written below.  
We also fixed some small bugs in the UI. Nothing to brag about.

## New Features

We have some new features for this release:

 *	Support for Selections  
	Until now the [Fixel Recolor][98] has always analyzed the whole image. Now, if there is an active selection [Fixel Recolor 1.5][98] will only use that section for analysis.  
	Pay attention that in case of *Soft Selection* only areas with more than 50% selection will be used for the analysis.
 *	Option to Sort Palette's Colors by Luminosity  
	New option in the *Palette Menu* to sort color by Luminosity.
 *	New Options for Blend Mode Used for Color Grading  
	Until now, any color grading would use *Linear Light* blend mode. [Fixel Recolor 1.5][98] adds the *Overlay* option as well.  
	See *Preferences Menu* to select your preferred *Blend Mode*.
 *	Import / Export of Palettes  
	Now, using the *Preferences Menu* the user can export / import palettes. Use `Shift` or `Ctrl` key for multiple selections.  
	It means you can share palettes with your friends and colleagues.  
	This was by far the most popular feature request.  
 *	Speed Improvements  
	We have invested time in the Plug In and our own proprietary algorithm to make it faster with the same quality.
