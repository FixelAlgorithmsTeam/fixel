# Fixel ReColor 1 PS Photoshop Plug In

## Background

Engineering is all about defining a problem (Supposedly interesting and solvable) and solve it.  
At Fixel, each one of the team is also a Photography Enthusiastic.  
Hence each of has encountered the following situation - Looking at great image and thinking, "*How can I recreates this colors in my image?*".  
Since we're also engineers, it seemed to us as a legitimate problem to define and try to solve.  


## Color Grading, Style Transfer & Color Palette

## Fixel Recolor 1 PS

### Under the Hood - Analyze, Extract, Use (Color Grading / Color Mapping / Style Transfer)

### User Interface (UI)
[Show UI and Explain Buttons]

### Tips & Tricks

[Number of Samples]  
[Grab from Internet - Windows]  
[Editing and Shuffling Palettes / Colors]

## Real World Examples

As one could see in the figure above, [Fixel Zone Selector][2] can generate Luminosity Masks which are arbitrary to the user will while being:
 * 	Focused - Can target specific luminosity level.
 *	Smooth - The curve is smooth (Using 32 Bit Float calculations regardless of the image) with no quantization error.
 *	Direct - Works directly on the image without overhead of calculations or sensitivity to the Gray Scale Color Profile of Photoshop.

Namely, [Fixel Zone Selector][2], by utilizing its own Luminosity Mask Generator, can overcome all issues mentioned above in Photoshop.  
Since it has a simple, intuitive, yet powerful UI, the user can have an effective tool to totally control the Luminosity Mask generation process.

## Summary
[Fixel Recolor 1 PS][98] introduces a new functionality which has never been available in Photoshop before - Automatic, Machine Learning Powered, analysis of image Color Palette.  
Once the user (Be a Photographer or Designer) has such a functionality it can be used in many ways.  
We tried making the UI of [Fixel Recolor 1 PS][98] intuitive and supportive of a user friendly workflow to use this capability to create user presets for Color Palettes, Integrate Colors into Photoshop (Swatches) and most of all - Recolor / Color Grade / Style Transfer the image.
