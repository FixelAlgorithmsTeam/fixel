Everywhere you go you hear Luminosity Masks.  
I'm really surprised it doesn't have its own Wikipedia Page (Maybe we'll take care of that).  
It is a truly great tool to have in your toolbox.

But how it works? Not in the sense how to create it, but really what happens?  
Well, let's try answering that and doing it deep (Hopefully interesting).

## The Basics

### Step 001 - It All Starts with a Grayscale Image
You can have image with all colors in the world but the first step in creating Luminosity Mask is by having a Grayscale image (Single Channel Image).
In most cases it means to calculate the Luminosity Channel of the given image.  
Each one with his recipe (Most actions / panels based solution uses Photoshop Luminosity selection - **Add Link**).

![Figure 001][Figure001]

By the way, any "Single Channel" image can do here. Namely one could use the Blue channel of RGB image as the base image for the creation of Luminosity Mask.  
Be crazy with that, anything can be a candidate (Yea, even the M channel in CMYK).

Well, in case of a grayscale image, one could just step over to Step 002.

### Step 002 - Apply Pixel Wise Transformation on the Grayscale Image

Now, this is the step you get to trick the system.  
The idea is very simple, given the Gray Scale image as input the output, per pixel, is a function only of its value.  
Well, this sentence might take some of us back to horrible school days but it is really simple when you think about it.  
Pixel comes in, says its value and get output value and voilÃ  we have a Luminosity Mask.

![Figure 002][Figure002]

The above "Mask Generator" seems to be generating a "Midtones Mask" since the output values for Mid Tone Values is high value.  
Since images are discrete, let's say in the case of 8 Bit image they have values in the range {0, 1, ..., 254, 255}.  
So a *Mask Generator* (Luminosity Mask Generator) needs to designate output value for each value in this range where the output is also within the range {0, 1, ..., 254, 255}.  
In the Computer Science world it is called [Look Up Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) (LUT).  

Over time some masks got their own naming according to what the values assigned.  
If it designate high output values to low input values and low values to the rest it is called "Shadows Mask Generator".  
If it designate high output values to mid input values and low values to the rest it is called "Midtones Mask Generator".  
If it designate high output values to high input values and low values to the rest it is called "Highlights Mask Generator".

This is the mask generation transformation (Mapping) and basically this is all theory there is to know.

### Examples
Let's do some stretching by simple example of 2 main building blocks of the Luminosity Mask world.  
We will assume 8 Bit Image hence input and output pixel values are given by {0, 1, 2, ..., 254, 255}.

The most basic Mapping / LUT / Function (All are different names to the same idea) is the identity mapping:

$$ f \left( x \right) = x $$

Namely, the output value is identical to the input value.  
This mask is called "Highlights Luminosity Mask".

Another basic mask is given by the negative (Inverse) of the Highlights Mask which is the Shadows Mask:

$$ f \left( x \right) = 255 - x $$

Using those 2 building blocks one could generate many other masks targeting different Tonal Ranges (Something will get to later).

![Figure 003][Figure003]

As can be seen above, the Midtones Mask is generated by scaled multiplication of the Highlights Mask and the Shadows Mask. Moreover, as can be seen by the Harmonic Function, one could do any mapping one wish.

**Remark**
In practice, data is scaled into [0, 1] range as operations, such as multiplication, makes more sense in that domain. So the range {0, 1, 2, ..., 254, 255} becomes {0 / 255, 1 / 255, 2 /255, ..., 254 / 255, 255/ 255}. This is exactly what's done in the above figure.

## In Practice
So now we know what's a Luminosity Mask Generator is and what is it doing let's try to understand how it is done in Photoshop.  
As discussed above, one need to create a LUT and there 2 main approaches doing so - The Calculations Tool or the Curve Tool.
One can apply each of those on Gratscale Image and the output is basically Luminosity Mask.

### Curve Tool
The [Curve Tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/curves-adjustment.html) is a Visualized LUT table by a Curve.  
It practically let the user draw the LUT. 

![Figure 004][Figure004]

On its bottom you can see the input values. On the left you can see the output value. You match between each value just by altering the curve according to your wish.
**Luminosity Mask Recipe**
 1. Create a Grayscale version of the image in a new layer ([Extract Luminosity](https://photoshoptrainingchannel.com/tips/loading-luminosity-keyboard-shortcut/), Select one of the channels, Desaturate the image, Use Channel Mixer, etc...).
 2. Open the Curve Tool.
 3. Draw the desired LUT.

### Calculations Tool
Using [Calculations Tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/channel-calculations.html) one could apply simple math operations on Layer / Channel / etc...  
Namely we can combine math operation by repetitive use of the Calculation tool.  
For instance, using the Calculation Tool we could easily generate the Midtones Mask from above by multiplying a layer and its inverse and scaling result by 4.
So it gives us the option to use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` on images.

### Comparison - Curve Tool vs. Calculations Tool

|               | Curve Tool                                                                                                                                                                       | Calculation Tool                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Advantages    | - No limits what so ever on the shape of the selection. <br/> -Complex mask can be achieved in operation.                                                                        | - Can be translated into exact Mathmatical expression. <br/> - Smooth result and gets better as the mode (8, 16, 32 Bit) get higher.                          |
| Disadvatnages | - Photoshop Curves are quantized into 256 [Davide?] levels which makes them less smooth. <br/> - No parameterization (Unless scripted) hence hard to be accurate and consistent. | - Limited to what can be done using the Blend Mode operations on the base Grayscale image. <br/> - Requires repetitive operations to get special selections (Slow). |
| Remarks       | Used by many Luminosity Mask panels out there, yet unless result can be achieved using Calculations, quality wise it is better use Calculations                                  | Usually used for its quality yet limited either by speed or can get arbitrary selection.                                                                      |

# Building Masks
In this part we will show how most of the masks out there are built using the Lego bricks we created.

![Figure 005][Figure005]

As one could see above, using Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication (Intersection), all operations available on Layers / Channels / Masks in Photoshop, one could easily generate all those "Classic" Luminosity Masks one could find in the wild (Wild world of the Luminosity Masks Panels).

Those with "Sharp Eye" would pay attention to something strange - Midtones Mask 001 is all black.  
Yet in practice, in all products out there, it is not?
So what's going on?
Well, what you see above is ideal Masks while Photoshop can not generate them in this quality.
We'll talk more on those pitfalls and strange behavior of classic Luminsoity Masks in the next writing.

# Summary
Now we understood what Luminosity Masks really are,  the actual operations and math behind them.  
We have shown the Luminosity Mask generation is no more than the most simple operation on grayscale image - Apply LUT / Pixel Wise Mapping.
What we saw is that there 2 main approaches for Luminosity Masks in Photoshop. While one gives the most flexibility and efficiency (Curve Tool) it lacks with quality and the other which generates smooth masks (Calculation Tool) has speed issues when trying to generate complex masks.
How can we solve those?

Well, this is what Fixel Zone Selector is all about.  
In the next part we'll talk about Zone Selector approach to Luminosity Masks.
