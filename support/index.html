							<dt>I bought a Fixel Algorithms product and I can't get it to work!</dt>
							<dd>We've set up a dedicated <a href="fixel-algorithms-support.html" target="_blank">"First Aid" support page</a> for Fixel Algorithms' Plug In troubleshooting.here.</dd>
						</div>
						<div class="def">
							<dt>How do I install your Plug In's?</dt>
							<dd>Our Plug In's are composed from a Plug In file (Does the heavy Math lifting) and UI (The Charm Personality). Just drop each of them to the correct place. See Installation Guide for more information.</dd>

							<dt>I upgraded to Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.5 and I'm havin issues with Fixel's Products, What should I do?</dt>
							<dd>Usually iti about installing the Plug In correctly for CC 2015.5. Adobe created a new shared folder for Photoshop CC 2015.5. All CC (CC, CC 2014, CC 2015, etc..) Users should (CC 2015.5 and above must) move the Plug In file into the new folder. Information on the shared folder is given in <a href:"http://blogs.adobe.com/crawlspace/2016/06/faq-photoshop-cc-2015-5-now-available.html" target="_blank">FAQ: Photoshop CC 2015.5 Now Available</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/plug-ins-photoshop-troubleshooting.html" target="_blank">How to Identify and Troubleshoot Issues with Plug Ins in Photoshop.</a></dd>
